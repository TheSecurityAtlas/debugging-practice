      <h1>Welcome to Debugging Challenges</h1>
      <hr>
      <p1>This site is designed to aid in your programming and security path. We, as of 8/18/22, have only C programming challenges, but we will soon have Python, C++, Java and Security challenges.</p1>
      <br><br>
      <p1>The challenges are set up in a way where you can download the challenge, do it, and view the associated web page for an in depth analysis of the challenge. For example, we may have a program that has 10 bugs, and one of those bugs is a buffer overflow. In the associated web page, we would explain to you how and why this is happening, as well has how to mitigate/fix this issue.</p1>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2>What resources will you need?</h2>
      <p1>What you need will vary based on the type of challenge, but a complete list will be found on the challenge's catagory page, such as <a href="en/challenges/runtime/clang/clang.html#resources">this</a>.</p1><br>
      <p1>In general, you will probably want to have a compiler and/or interpreter for the target language, a disassembler, and a debugger. Extra resources can be listed on the challenge's associated web page.</p1>
